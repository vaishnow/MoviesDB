## About

This website is built using React 18.2 and use TMDB API to fetch Movies and TV Show data.

Currently this is a work in process

<!-- On this website, users can search for and explore movies and TV Shows, as well as bookmark their favorites for easy access later. This website is also fully responsive, so it can be easily accessed and used on any device, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. -->

To get started, you will need to obtain an API key from TMDB by creating an account on their website (https://www.themoviedb.org/). Once you have your API key, you can set it as an environment variable.

To run the website locally, clone the repository and run the following commands:

1. Clone repository using git clone
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vaishnow/MoviesDB moviesdb
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
    cd moviesdb
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
4. Get your TMDB API key from [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and set it as an environment variable in `.env` file
   ```bash
    VITE_TMDB_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
   ```
5. Run the development server
   ```bash
    npm run dev
   ```

This will start the development server and the website will be available at http://localhost:5173.
